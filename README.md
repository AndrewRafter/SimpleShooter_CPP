Note: This game is from the course "UE5 C++ Developer: Code Your Own Unreal Games" found at gamedev.tv  
Due to the large file size of Unreal projects I am unable to upload the entire file to GitHub, here is the C++ code.

Title: SimpleShooter
============

Description:
------------
The project is quick demo where the player can move around through a level and shoot enemies. The enemies use pathfinding to follow the player and will shoot back when close enough. They will also lose track of the player if their line of sight breaks. The level ends when either the player dies or they kill all the enemies.
